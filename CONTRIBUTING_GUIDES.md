## Folder Structure

All build guides are organized under `docs/hardware/guides/` with the following structure:

```
docs/hardware/guides/
├── backplates/
│   ├── anthead/
│   │   ├── data.yml          # Assembly configuration
│   │   ├── Anthead_SF.glb    # 3D model file
│   │   ├── assembly.md       # Assembly page
│   │   └── index.md          # Overview page
│   └── [other_backplates]/
├── toolheads/
│   ├── anthead/
│   │   ├── data.yml
│   │   ├── Anthead.glb
│   │   ├── assembly.md
│   │   └── index.md
│   └── [other_toolheads]/
├── modular_docks/
├── cable_management/
├── calibration_tools/
├── shuttles/
└── tophats/
```

### Category Folders

Each category folder (e.g., `toolheads`, `backplates`) contains individual guide folders. The category name is used by the `get_hardware()` macro to retrieve guide data.

### Guide Folders

Each guide folder must contain:
- **`data.yml`** - The assembly configuration file
- **`[ModelName].glb`** - The 3D model file referenced in `data.yml`
- **`assembly.md`** - Page that displays the assembly viewer
- **`index.md`** - Overview page with embedded assembly viewer

---

## Required Files

### 1. data.yml

The main configuration file that defines the assembly guide. See [YAML Configuration Reference](#yaml-configuration-reference) for details.

### 2. 3D Model (.glb)

A GLB (GL Transmission Format Binary) file containing the 3D model. The model should:
- Have clearly named parts/meshes that match the names used in `visible` and `focus` arrays
- Be optimized for web viewing (reasonable polygon count)
- Include all parts needed for the assembly

### 3. assembly.md

A simple markdown file that loads the assembly viewer:

```markdown
# [Guide Name] Assembly

{% set assembly = get_hardware("category_name")["Guide Title"] %}
{% include "_templates/assembly_viewer.md" %}
```

**Example:**
```markdown
# Anthead Assembly

{% set assembly = get_hardware("toolheads")["Anthead"] %}
{% include "_templates/assembly_viewer.md" %}
```

### 4. index.md

An overview page that includes both overview information and the assembly viewer:

```markdown
# [Guide Name]

{% set assembly = get_hardware("category_name")["Guide Title"] %}

{% include "_templates/overview.md" %}

## Assembly
{% include "_templates/assembly_viewer.md" %}
```

---

## Camera Configuration

The camera configuration controls the view angle and position for each step. Understanding these parameters is crucial for creating effective assembly guides.

### Camera Parameters

#### `azimuth` (0-360)
Horizontal rotation around the model in degrees.
- **0°** - Front view
- **90°** - Right side view
- **180°** - Back view
- **270°** - Left side view

```yaml
azimuth: 214  # Viewing from the back-left
```

#### `polar` (0-180)
Vertical angle in degrees.
- **0°** - Top-down view
- **90°** - Eye-level view
- **180°** - Bottom-up view

```yaml
polar: 47  # Viewing from above at a 47° angle
```

#### `distance`
Distance from the camera to the model center. Smaller values zoom in, larger values zoom out.

```yaml
distance: 28  # Relatively close view
```

#### `pan_x`, `pan_y`, `pan_z`
Camera pan offsets to center the view on specific parts.
- **pan_x**: Left (-) / Right (+)
- **pan_y**: Down (-) / Up (+)
- **pan_z**: Back (-) / Forward (+)

```yaml
pan_x: 0.30   # Shift view slightly right
pan_y: 0.92   # Shift view up
pan_z: 0.00   # No forward/back shift
```

### Finding Camera Values

To find the correct camera values for your steps:

1. **Enable Camera Overlay**: While viewing your assembly in the browser, press the o key to enable the camera overlay (top-right corner) which shows real-time camera values
2. **Manually Adjust View**: Use mouse controls to position the camera:
   - Left-click drag: Rotate (changes azimuth and polar)
   - Right-click drag: Pan (changes pan_x, pan_y, pan_z)
   - Scroll wheel: Zoom (changes distance)
3. **Copy Values**: Once you have the desired view, click the overlay to copy the values from the camera overlay into your YAML file

### Camera Examples

**Top-down view of heat insert locations:**
```yaml
camera:
  azimuth: 270
  polar: 15
  distance: 35
  pan_x: 0.00
  pan_y: 0.00
  pan_z: 0.00
```

**Close-up angled view of screw installation:**
```yaml
camera:
  azimuth: 124
  polar: 97
  distance: 22
  pan_x: -0.18
  pan_y: -0.46
  pan_z: 0.00
```

**Wide view showing complete assembly:**
```yaml
camera:
  azimuth: 59
  polar: 54
  distance: 87
  pan_x: 1.23
  pan_y: -3.50
  pan_z: 0.00
```

## Part Visibility and Focus

Understanding how to control part visibility and focus is key to creating clear assembly instructions.

### Visibility Strategy

**Progressive Assembly**: Show only the parts relevant to the current step. As the assembly progresses, keep previous parts visible to provide context.

```yaml
# Step 1: Just the main body and inserts
- title: "Install Heat Inserts"
  visible:
    - "Main Body"
    - "Heat Inserts"
  focus:
    - "Heat Inserts"

# Step 2: Add the backplate, keep previous parts visible
- title: "Attach Backplate"
  visible:
    - "Main Body"
    - "Heat Inserts"
    - "Backplate"
    - "Backplate Screws"
  focus:
    - "Backplate Screws"
```

### Focus Highlighting

Use `focus` to draw attention to:
- **New parts** being added in the current step
- **Specific locations** where action is required (screw holes, insert locations)
- **Critical alignment points**

**Example: Highlighting new hardware:**
```yaml
- title: "Attach Ducts"
  description: "Secure each duct to the Main Body with 2 M3x8 BHCS screws."
  visible:
    - "Main Body"
    - "Duct Left"
    - "Duct Right"
    - "Duct Screws"
  focus:
    - "Duct Screws"  # Highlight just the screws, not the ducts
```

### Part Naming Conventions

Part names in the GLB model should be:
- **Descriptive**: `"Main Body"` not `"Part_001"`
- **Consistent**: Use the same naming pattern throughout
- **Grouped logically**: Related hardware can share prefixes (e.g., `"Duct Left"`, `"Duct Right"`)

## Best Practices

### 1. Model Preparation
- **Optimize polygon count**: Keep models web-friendly (aim for under 100k polygons)
- **Name meshes clearly**: Use descriptive names that make sense in the context
- **Separate hardware**: Create individual meshes for screws, inserts, etc.
- **Test the model**: Load it in the viewer before creating all steps

### 2. Step Organization
- **Logical progression**: Follow the natural assembly order
- **One action per step**: Don't combine multiple unrelated actions
- **Clear descriptions**: Be specific about quantities, orientations, and techniques
- **Consistent terminology**: Use the same terms throughout the guide

### 3. Camera Positioning
- **Frame the action**: Center the camera on what the user needs to see
- **Appropriate zoom**: Close enough to see details, far enough for context
- **Consistent angles**: Use similar angles for similar operations
- **Test on mobile**: Ensure views work on smaller screens

### 4. Part Visibility
- **Show context**: Include previously assembled parts for reference
- **Minimize clutter**: Hide parts that obstruct the view
- **Use focus wisely**: Highlight only the most important parts
- **Progressive disclosure**: Reveal parts as they become relevant

### 5. Documentation
- **Include warnings**: Call out critical steps or common mistakes
- **Reference other guides**: Link to related assembly guides when appropriate
- **Provide alternatives**: Document different options where applicable
- **Add tips**: Include helpful hints from your experience

### 6. Testing
- **Walk through the guide**: Follow your own instructions step-by-step
- **Check all links**: Verify BOM URLs work correctly
- **Test in the viewer**: Ensure all parts appear correctly
- **Get feedback**: Have someone else try to follow the guide

### 7. Markdown Features
You can use markdown formatting in descriptions:

```yaml
description: |
  Install the screws in this order:
  
  1. Top left
  2. Top right
  3. Bottom left
  4. Bottom right
  
  **Important:** Do not overtighten!
```

You can also use admonitions in the summary:

```yaml
summary: >
  This is a complex assembly.
  
  !!! warning "Take Your Time"
      This step requires precision. Rushing may damage components.
  
  !!! tip "Pro Tip"
      Pre-threading the heat inserts makes installation easier.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Parts Not Appearing
- Verify part names in YAML exactly match mesh names in GLB
- Check for typos and case sensitivity
- Ensure the GLB file is in the same directory as data.yml

### Camera Position Issues
- Use the camera overlay to find correct values
- Remember that pan values can be negative
- Test the view at different screen sizes

### Model Loading Slowly
- Reduce polygon count in your 3D modeling software
- Optimize textures (use smaller images)
- Consider splitting very complex models

### Colors Not Applying
- Check that part names are in the correct color arrays
- Verify part names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Remember that focus color overrides other colors
