# Software Overview

## Klipper
StealthChanger has been tested and verified to work with [Klipper](#){:target="_blank"}-based 3D printers. Other firmware platforms are not currently supported.

## Klipper-toolchanger
Often referred to as KTC, [klipper-toolchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/klipper-toolchanger){:target="_blank"} is a collection of extensions developed by [viesturz](https://github.com/viesturz){:target="_blank"} that add tool-changing functionality to [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper){:target="_blank"}. StealthChanger uses a fork of this project called [klipper-toolchanger-easy](https://github.com/jwellman80/klipper-toolchanger-easy){:target="_blank"} — also known as KTC-easy — which has been streamlined and optimized specifically for the StealthChanger community.

## Slicer Support
StealthChanger is compatible with most modern slicers that offer multi-tool or tool-changing functionality. This includes popular open-source options such as:

{% for slicer in slicers %}
* [{{ slicer }}](slicers.md#{{ slicer|lower }}){:target="_blank"}
{% endfor %}
