title: Axiscope Camera
author: "N3MI"
summary: >
    A camera which complements the [Axiscope](https://github.com/nic335/Axiscope){:target="_blank"} software to get precise XY alignment between the tool's nozzles.

    !!! danger "Requires Soldering"
        This guide requires soldering LEDs on to a PCB. If you are uncomfortable with soldering, there are cameras available for purchase, notably the [CXC Camera by Ember Prototypes](https://www.emberprototypes.com/products/cxc){:target="_blank"}.
