| The extruder idler can interfere with the cross bar as shown above | Using a door buffer resolves this issue |

!!! tip "Alternatives"
    If a Door Buffer is not your thing, there is an alternative usermod solution in the form of shortened front idlers. They are called [MiniBFI and MicroBFI](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/tree/main/UserMods/BT123/MiniBFI%20%2B%20MicroBFI), for Voron and Micron respectively. They eliminate the requirement for a Door Buffer at the expense of shorter idler adjustment.
