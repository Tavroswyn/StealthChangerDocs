summary: >
  This guide will walk you through the assembly of an Anthead for StealthChanger with community usermods.

  !!! tip "Making the best better?"
      The stock Anthead works really well with StealthChanger, however with some small tweaks we can make it even better. 
      This guide introduces some community usermods to make a complete and robust solution for reliable tool changes with StealthChanger.
