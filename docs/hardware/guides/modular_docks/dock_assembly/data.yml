title: Modular Dock Assembly
model: "Dock - Assembly.gltf"
# image: "/assets/dock-base_a4t.png"

summary: >
    This guide will guide you through the assembly of the Modular Dock. It is presumed you have already assembled the [Blocker](/hardware/modular_dock/#blocker), [Base](/hardware/modular_dock/#base) and [Frame](/hardware/modular_dock/#frame) sub-assemblies.

    !!! note "Variations"
        [Spring Steel Blocker](/hardware/guides/modular_docks/blocker_spring_steel/), [Anthead Base](/hardware/guides/modular_docks/base_anthead/) and [Standard Crossbar Frame](/hardware/guides/modular_docks/frame_standard_crossbar/) are used for the purpose of this guide. You may be using different parts, but the assembly process is the same.
