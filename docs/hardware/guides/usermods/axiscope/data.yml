summary: >
    A camera which complements the [Axiscope](https://github.com/nic335/Axiscope){:target="_blank"} software to get precise XY alignment between the tool's nozzles.

    !!! danger "Requires Soldering"
        This guide requires soldering LEDs on to a PCB. If you are uncomfortable with soldering, there are cameras available for purchase, notably the [CXC Camera by Ember Prototypes](https://www.emberprototypes.com/products/cxc){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: "LED Alignment"
    description: "On the PCB there will be silkscreen of the diode symbol (A triangle pointing towards a line) in 6 places. The LEDs will be installed in the holes where the 4 corner symbols are. The LEDs have a flat side and a shorter leg, this is the cathode (negative) leg. Place the led through the holes from the lens side ensuring the cathode is through the hole where the line and point of the triangle are."

  - title: "Testing"
    description: "Before completing the assembly, its a good idea to test the electronics to make sure everything works. Check polarity with a multimeter if you have one. Plugging the module in to a PC should turn the LEDs on and the camera should be available as a webcam."
