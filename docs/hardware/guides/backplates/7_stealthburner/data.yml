  - description: "Test the operation. If your Shuttle and Backplate do not move smoothly, try loosening the top 2 screws, twist the pins and re-tighten while meshed with the Shuttle. A small amount of resistance is not nessacerily a bad thing. If you believe the weight of the toolhead would reliably mesh the Shuttle and Backplate, continue to the next step. If you are unable to achieve smooth operation between the Backplate and Shuttle, please consult the [Hardware Troubleshooting](../../../troubleshooting/)."

  - description: "Set the preload for the Backplate by backing out the 2 M3x6 FHCS screws in small increments until they both make even contact with the magnets in the shuttle. An easy way ensure even contact is by using a slither of paper between the screw and magnet similar setting z offset."
