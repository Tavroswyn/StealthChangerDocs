title: Umbilical
author: "DraftShift Design"
summary: >
    This guide will walk you through the assembly of an Umbilical. 

    !!! tip "Bending"
        Spring steel can snap rather easily when bending. Before bending, heat the area with a blow torch or lighter to a cherry (dull) red and let it cool. This helps make the steel more ductile and allows you to bend without snapping. 

    !!! tip "More Information"
