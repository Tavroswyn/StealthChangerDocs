title: Extrusion Tophat
author: "DraftShift Design"
summary: >
    The Extrusion version of the Tophat uses aluminum extrusions and acrylic panels to create a sturdy frame that looks like extension of the 3d Printer.

    !!! tip "Where can I get one?"
        The hardware components for this guide are all included as a part of LDO's `StealthChanger Tophat and Door Buffer Kit`.

    !!! info "Frame"
        This guide assumes you have built a Voron 2.4 3d printer. 
        If you are building this Tophat before your printer, it is highly advised to make yourself familiar with the Voron 2.4 manual in regards to the frame assembly.
