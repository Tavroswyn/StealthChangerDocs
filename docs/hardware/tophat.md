## The Problem
While the tools are parked or when printing high up, the umbilical extends past the top of the printer. Most printers let the umbilical touch the top or go to the side. That is not an option for StealthChanger, the umbilical would interfere with other tools or their umbilical and could pull them from their dock. 

## The Solutions

### Extrusion Tophat
The Extrusion Tophat is like an extension of your printer, it uses the same extrusion and panel design as the printers frame. See the below table for a list of extrusion and panel sizes per printer size:

| Printer | Vertical Extrusion | Horizontal Extrusion | Panels |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Voron 350 | 250mm x4 | 470mm x8 | 483x223x3mm x4 |
| Voron 300 | 200mm x4 | 420mm x8 | 433x173x3mm x4 |
| Voron 250 | 200mm x4 | 370mm x8 | 383x173x3mm x4 |
| Micron 180 | 150mm x4 | 280mm x8 | 290x130x3mm x4 |

!!! tip "LDO Kit"
    The hardware required for the Extrusion Tophat comes as part of LDO's `Tophat and Door Buffer Kit`.

### Printed Tophat
The Printed Tophat was developed for users that do not have easy access to aluminium extrusion or acrylic panels. The only additional hardware is screws, nut and heat inserts.

!!! tip "Interim Tophat"
    Many of our members have fabricated a Tophat from cardboard which can be used while printing the pieces for your Printed Tophat.

### Do Nothing
If you plan on only printing open air, then you do not necessarily require a Tophat. You could just remove the top panel and let the umbilical cables extend past the top of the printer. 

## Assembly
The assembly guides for the Tophats can be found in the [Build Guides](guides/tophats/index.md) section.
