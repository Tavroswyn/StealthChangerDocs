## Klipper-toolchanger-easy
Connect to the printer via SSH and enter the following commands:

``` bash { .copy }
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/jwellman80/klipper-toolchanger-easy.git
cd ~/klipper-toolchanger-easy
./install.sh
```

You will be prompted to decide a Z probe solution. A typical StealthChanger uses the built-in tap sensor for probing and option 1 should be chosen.

``` bash
1. I will use the TAP sensor as my Z probe on each tool
2. I will use a shuttle mounted Beacon/Cartographer/Eddy/etc as my Z probe
```

!!! example "Eddy Current"
    Eddy current sensors on StealthChanger have additional requirements and some limitations, they are considered experimental. 

After installation, your configuration will be organized as follows:

```
~/printer_data/config/toolchanger/
├── readonly-configs/          # DO NOT EDIT - Symlinked macros
│   └── toolchanger-include.cfg
├── tools/                     # Tool-specific configurations
│   ├── T0.cfg
│   ├── T1.cfg
│   └── ...
├── toolchanger-config.cfg     # User-editable overrides
└── example_T0.cfg             # Example configurations
    example_T1.cfg
```

Optional, but recommended, add the following to your `moonraker.conf` to enable automatic updates:

``` cfg { .copy }
[update_manager klipper-toolchanger-easy]
type: git_repo
path: ~/klipper-toolchanger-easy
origin: https://github.com/jwellman80/klipper-toolchanger-easy.git
managed_services: klipper
primary_branch: main
```
